Project dedicated to the test - SoftExpert

Made with ReactJS on Frontend, PHP 5.6 on Backend and Postgres on Database.

## How to test

### FRONTEND

In the Frontend project directory, you must:

- Run a `yarn` command to install all the dependencies
- After all the dependencies installed, execute `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### BACKEND

In the Backend project directory, you must:

- Copy it to an Apache server with PHP 5.6. ( I used the xampp )
- Run the Apache server and the app will be started.

### DATABASE

In the Database project directory, you must:

- Run a `docker-compose up -d --build` command, to mount and start the Docker Container.
- After the Container up, the Database will be mounted and created automatically.

After all these steps, is just start to use it.

ENJOY!
